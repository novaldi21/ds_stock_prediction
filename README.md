# Stock Prediction: Project Overview 
* Building a future stock prediction model using LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) Algorithm
* Data used was a daily stock prices of 500 companies from 2013 to 2018 from Kaggle
* Data consisted with 7 columns and 1259 rows for each company
* Model predicts open stock prices of GOOGL
* Building visualization for prediction model plot

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, keras, TensorFlow.

## Dataset
To predict future stock using LSTM, datased used was a daily stock prices of 500 companies from 2013 to 2018 with details are following:
*	Name
*	Date
*	Open
*	High
*	Low 
* Close
* Volume
<br />In this project, I chose to predict open stock price for 1 company, which is GOOGL open stock prices.

## Data Pre-Processing
First, I did a feature scaling to the data to get optimal performance by using Scikit- Learnâ€™s MinMaxScaler and scale the dataset to numbers between zero and one.
<br />After that, since LSTM expect data to be in 3D format, I converted the data into a 3D dimension array with X_train samples, 60 timestamps, and one feature at each step.

## Model Building 

First, I built the LSTM model before building the test set. The LSTM model building used Keras library with several adjustments, which are:
<br />1. Adding 50 units which is the dimensionality of the output space to prevent overfitting.
<br />2. Defining Dropout layers by 0.2, meaning that 20% of the layers will be dropped.
<br />3. Adding Dense layer that specifies the output of 1 unit.
<br />4. compile the model using adam optimizer and set the loss as the mean_squarred_error. This will compute the mean of the squared errors.
<br />After adjustments, we fit the model to run on 100 epochs with a batch size of 32.

Finally, I did the future stock prediction of GOOGL open price by merging the training set and the test set on the 0 axis, set the time step as 60, used MinMaxScaler to transform the new dataset, and reshaped the dataset afterward.

The code for model building can be seen [here](https://github.com/novaldi21/ds_stock_prediction/blob/master/Stock_Prediction.ipynb)

## Model plotting
The model plotting visualization between the real price and predicted price presented in the figure below.

From the figure it can be seen that the prediction tools was able to predict the open stock price of GOOGL based on the plot movement on the graph.
